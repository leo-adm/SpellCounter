# SpellsTimer
An application for League of Legends players

This app is designed to help players count the cooldown of enemies spells.

First you need to write some player's name and if it's in an active match, you will
be redirected to the main page. There you'll see all enemies champions with their respectives spells.
This is done using the Riot's API to get active games infos and ddragon to get the images. The app is
written in JavaScript with React-Native.

P.S. In order to use the app, it requires a Riot's API Key, that you can get at https://developer.riotgames.com/.
This app was made with the LEARNING PURPOSE and Riot disapproves apps that give players some sort of advantage.
